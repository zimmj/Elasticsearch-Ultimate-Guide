# Search And More

[Search](./Search) is the main feature of Elasticsearch.
But with a search-request we can as well perform other function like:

* [Aggregation](./todo)
* [Highlighting](./todo)

To gain more information from our stored data.
With this extra function we can as well build new extra features as:

* Type-Ahead
* Filter with amount
* Simple Statistic for data

And more.
