# Your Own Search

The best way to understand all the concept from mapping, search and analyzing is to use it in practical example.
For this we will use the simple data from a survey of stack overflow.
This survey can be simple loaded into Elasticsearch with the EXE:

TODO create EXE in C# and add line attribute to set Elasticsearch local port.

## Prerequisite

Before you start with this example you should understand:

1. How [mapping](../Mapping) is done in Elasticsearch.
2. What [Analyzers](../Analyzer) are.
3. How to write search in Elasticsearch

TODOS

* survey loader is an executable for windows and mac
* Define how search should work
* Used as well for type-ahead example
